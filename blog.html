                        Definition of PennyLane, taken directly from their <a href="https://pennylane.ai/">site</a>:
                        <blockquote>
                            A cross-platform Python library for differentiable programming of quantum computers. 
                            Train a quantum computer the same way as a neural network.
                        </blockquote>
                        "Differentiable programming" is a term that I'm not familar with, after
                        googling a definition, it becomes even less clear:
                        <blockquote>
                            Differentiable programming is a programming paradigm in which a numeric 
                            computer program can be differentiated throughout via automatic differentiation.
                        </blockquote>
                        From what I can gather this tool is related to machine learning,
                        and / or artificial intelligence. I have worked at many companies
                        that use these catchy, snazzy terms, but nine times out of ten,
                        they are usually just algorithms (or just plain code) written to
                        handle a variety of different specifically defined scenarios. The 
                        "learning" part of the process is usually noticeable absent. 
                        Nevertheless, I remain open-minded, if nothing else perhaps
                        it will familarize myself with quantum computing concepts.

                        PennyLane first requires a "quantum device" to run code.
                        <blockquote>
                            In PennyLane, a device could be a hardware device (such as the IBM QX4, via 
                            the PennyLane-PQ plugin), or a software simulator (such as Strawberry Fields, 
                            via the PennyLane-SF plugin).
                        </blockquote>

                        This tool maybe a very good introduction to quantum computing.
                        In my mind, a "hello world" example would be to get a simulated
                        quantum computer running on my local machine.

                        Open question: is a quantum photonic hardware the same as normal
                        quantum computing? how does it differ using light?

                        The hardware side has a big learning curve involving quantum mechanics and all the

                    <p>
                        I have recently been researching Quantum Computing from a very high level. My interest in the field was due to a
                        conversation in a Podcast called Unchained (https://unchainedpodcast.com/). Mark Cuban mentioned that once quantum
                        computing becomes more prevalent, and readily available, it will become possible to hack certain blockchains.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is a very big concern for investors and users of the technology, so I want to learn all I can about the subject.
                        I came across a javascript library called Q.js (different from the old promise library that was so popular):
                        https://quantumjavascript.app/
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I hope to create a project using this library in the near future.

                        <small>March 13, 2018</small>

                    <p>
                        I came across this problem today. I attempted to fix a unit test that was testing a service.
                        The service had a function that accepted a parameter, did some processing and then dispatched
                        a change to a redux store.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First, the test got data from the store. Then, it made a call to the service file to change it.
                        Then it selected the changed object from the store, and "expected" that it would change.

                        The project had recently been updated from NgRx 2 to NgRx 4, and so a few changes had occurred.
                        Particularly, the select method now returned an Observable. Previously, the test could just
                        inspect an array, compare values before and after the change.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So I thought I could subscribe
                        to the observable, inspect the value, dispatch the change, and then inspect the value again.

                        However, I came across some interesting behavior, the test would just hang and fail, with no
                        output. What was happening? After rethinking what I had implemented, I realized I was
                        dispatching within a subscribe, and thus creating an infinite loop. The subscribe would trigger
                        after each dispatch (and thus never end).

                        What I wanted was for the subscription to complete after one emission, and I came across the
                        first method. This method seemingly completes after 1 emission.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This made it so that after the first subscription, and the first dispatch, we didn't re-enter
                        the subscribe method again.
