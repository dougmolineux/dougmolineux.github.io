He argues that it’s problematic when the biotechnology and biomedicine industries are driven primarily by capitalism.</p>\n<p>One part of the book describes how the new industry norm involves scientists and stakeholders being present during major discoveries, with little room for \"detached observers\" who could provide ethical oversight. This lack of independent perspective raises concerns about whether profit motives overshadow responsible research.</p>\n<p>The question of whether capitalism drives scientific innovation is an interesting one. On one hand, many medical breakthroughs—such as the rapid development of the COVID-19 vaccine by an American company—have been fueled by competitive incentives. Similarly, advancements in treating diseases like cystic fibrosis have progressed significantly in the U.S., partly due to financial rewards driving research.</p>\n<h2>Distrust of Science in <em>Jurassic Park</em></h2>\n<p>A strong theme in <em>Jurassic Park</em> is a deep skepticism toward science, particularly genetic modification. The book portrays it as an unnatural human invention, something to be feared rather than embraced. While this perspective makes for compelling fiction, it doesn’t fully capture the real-world benefits of genetic modification.</p>\n<h2>The Overlooked Benefits of Genetic Modification</h2>\n<h3>1. <strong>Food Security and Agriculture</strong></h3>\n<p>Genetic modification isn’t some distant, sci-fi concept—it’s already part of our daily lives. Many of the foods we eat, such as bananas, corn, and soybeans, have been selectively bred or genetically altered to improve yield, resistance to pests, and nutritional value. Without these modifications, global food shortages would be far more severe.</p>\n<p>For example, Golden Rice was engineered to contain beta-carotene, addressing vitamin A deficiencies in developing countries. If used more widely, such innovations could prevent malnutrition and hunger on a massive scale.</p>\n<h3>2. <strong>Medicine and Disease Prevention</strong></h3>\n<p>Beyond food, genetic modification plays a crucial role in modern medicine. Insulin, once extracted from animal pancreases, is now mass-produced using genetically modified bacteria, making it more accessible and affordable.</p>\n<p>Gene therapy is another frontier—scientists are editing DNA to treat genetic disorders like sickle cell anemia and even certain cancers. CRISPR technology allows for precise genetic corrections, offering potential cures rather than just treatments.</p>\n<h3>3. <strong>Environmental Sustainability</strong></h3>\n<p>GM crops can reduce the need for harmful pesticides and increase drought resistance, helping farmers adapt to climate change. Scientists are also exploring genetic solutions to combat invasive species and restore damaged ecosystems.</p>\n<p><em>Jurassic Park</em> excels at dramatizing the dangers of unchecked scientific ambition, but it’s worth considering the other side of the story. Genetic modification, when regulated and ethically applied, has the potential to solve some of humanity’s biggest challenges—from hunger to disease.</p>\n<p>Rather than fearing science, we should focus on ensuring it’s guided by transparency, ethical oversight, and a commitment to public good—not just profit. As like many things it appears that the answer is somewhere in the middle.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Detached Observer","date":"2025-05-01"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2025-05-01-detached-observer/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
