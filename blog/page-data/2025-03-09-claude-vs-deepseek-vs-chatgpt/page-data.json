The process to get gatsby to produce the static files from markdown is unexplainably difficult. It would have been easier to build this blog manually with React and HTML.</p>\n<p>I think ChatGPT is probably the best of the three when trying to create NodeJS applications, but its free tier runs out fairly quickly.
