Within this cavity, the <strong>vibrational spectra of C-H bonds</strong> in lipid molecules can generate <strong>entangled biphotons</strong> through cascade emission. The authors demonstrate, using a theoretical model, that the <strong>myelin's structure facilitates significant quantum entanglement</strong>, with the degree of entanglement being highest at specific myelin thicknesses that align with biological observations. This research suggests a <strong>potential role for quantum information transfer</strong> in the nervous system, offering a new perspective on the brain's complex synchronized activity. The findings could potentially link changes in myelin thickness to neurodegenerative diseases through the lens of quantum entanglement.</p>\n<p><a href=\"../assets/myelin-orch.pdf\">Download the PDF</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Entangled Biphoton Generation in Myelin Sheath","date":"2025-07-14"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2025-07-14-biphoton/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
