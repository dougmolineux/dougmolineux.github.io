If Alice performs a measurement on her system, Bob’s system instantaneously assumes a correlated value—in some cases, the opposite outcome.</p>\n<p>This phenomenon is sometimes called <em>quantum steering</em>, where Alice’s measurement appears to influence Bob’s system. At first glance, this suggests two possible explanations: either Alice’s system sends some sort of faster-than-light signal to Bob’s, or the outcomes were predetermined <em>before the systems separated</em>.</p>\n<p>A second possibility aligns with <em>hidden variable</em> theories, where unobserved properties (hidden variables) predetermine measurement results. However, experiments based on Bell’s theorem have ruled out local hidden variable theories, meaning any viable hidden variable explanation must involve non-locality.</p>\n<h2>Speculative Suggestion: There's only one</h2>\n<p>Is it possible that there is really only be one particle, but in our dimension, it is \"split\" and far apart? Perhaps the one particle exists in some plane or dimension, but in our universe it exists as two symmetrical, separate entities.</p>\n<h2>Wormhole</h2>\n<p>Could there be a subatomic wormhole between the two entangled particles in which information is transferred between the two particules?</p>\n<p>There is a paper written by Juan Maldacena and Leonard Susskind named \"Cool horizons for entangled black holes\" that proposes this maybe the case:</p>\n<pre><code>General relativity contains solutions in which two distant black holes are con-\nnected through the interior via a wormhole, or Einstein-Rosen bridge. These solu-\ntions can be interpreted as maximally entangled states of two black holes that form\na complex EPR pair. We suggest that similar bridges might be present for more\ngeneral entangled states.\n</code></pre>","frontmatter":{"title":"Non-Locality in Quantum Entanglement","date":"2025-04-18"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2025-04-18-non-locality/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
