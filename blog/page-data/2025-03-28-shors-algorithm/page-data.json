This discovery forced a global re-evaluation of digital security and sparked a race toward <strong>post-quantum cryptography</strong>.</p>\n<h2>How Shor's Algorithm Works</h2>\n<h3>1. The Problem: Factoring Large Numbers</h3>\n<p>Most modern encryption relies on the difficulty of <strong>factoring large integers</strong>. For example, RSA encryption uses a public key that is the product of two massive prime numbers. Classical computers take <strong>thousands of years</strong> to factor these numbers, making brute-force attacks impractical.</p>\n<h3>2. Quantum Speedup: From Exponential to Polynomial Time</h3>\n<p>Shor's algorithm exploits quantum mechanics to factor numbers exponentially faster than classical methods:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)</strong> – Converts the problem into a frequency domain</li>\n<li><strong>Modular Exponentiation</strong> – Uses quantum parallelism</li>\n<li><strong>Period Finding</strong> – Identifies patterns that reveal factors</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Post-Quantum Cryptography Solutions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Lattice-based cryptography (e.g., CRYSTALS-Kyber)</li>\n<li>Hash-based signatures (e.g., SPHINCS+)</li>\n<li>Code-based cryptography (e.g., McEliece)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>When Will Quantum Computers Run Shor's Algorithm?</h2>\n<h3>Hardware Requirements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Logical Qubits Needed</strong>: ~1 million</li>\n<li><strong>Current Status</strong>: ~1,000 noisy physical qubits</li>\n<li><strong>Timeline Estimates</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>Optimistic: 2035-2040</li>\n<li>Conservative: 2050+</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Shor's algorithm represents both a <strong>scientific breakthrough</strong> and <strong>security threat</strong>. While practical quantum computers capable of running it remain years away, the transition to quantum-resistant encryption must begin now.</p>\n<p><strong>Further Reading:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography\">NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/\">IBM Quantum Experiments</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9508027\">Original Shor's Paper</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Shor's Algorithm","date":"2025-03-28"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2025-03-28-shors-algorithm/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
