Enter Ship of Harkinian, a remarkable community-driven PC port that transforms this classic into a modern gaming experience while preserving everything that made the original special.</p>\n<h2>What is Ship of Harkinian?</h2>\n<p>Ship of Harkinian is an unofficial PC port of the game based on a 2021 decompilation of the game's code. Developed by the Harbour Masters team, this project takes the fully reverse-engineered code from the Zelda Reverse Engineering Team and creates a native PC application that runs Ocarina of Time without emulation.</p>\n<p>The name \"Ship of Harkinian\" is a clever play on words referring to the ship-building mini-game in The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, where players help a character named Harkinian. This project represents a similar journey of reconstruction and enhancement.</p>\n<h2>Key Features and Enhancements</h2>\n<h3>Performance Improvements</h3>\n<p>This is a much better way to play than emulation. It has a ton of features built directly in, biggest of all is frame interpolation so you can play at 60+ fps (I can get up to 240fps), wide-screen resolutions (even ultrawide), as well as the built in Randomizer options.</p>\n<p>The most immediately noticeable improvement is the silky-smooth performance. No longer constrained by 90s console hardware, your experience will now be as silky smooth as your modern GPU and monitor can handle! The game can run at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>60+ FPS</strong>: Frame interpolation allows for buttery-smooth gameplay</li>\n<li><strong>High refresh rates</strong>: Support for 120Hz, 144Hz, and even 240Hz monitors</li>\n<li><strong>Variable resolution</strong>: From 1080p to 4K and beyond</li>\n<li><strong>Widescreen support</strong>: Including ultrawide 21:9 and 32:9 aspect ratios</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Visual Enhancements</h3>\n<p>The port includes numerous visual improvements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>HD graphics</strong>: Enhanced textures and visual fidelity</li>\n<li><strong>Modern rendering</strong>: Updated graphics pipeline for better performance</li>\n<li><strong>Widescreen adaptation</strong>: Proper UI scaling for modern displays</li>\n<li><strong>Texture filtering</strong>: Smoother, cleaner visuals</li>\n<li><strong>Anti-aliasing</strong>: Reduced jagged edges</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Built-in Randomizer</h3>\n<p>Shuffle what rewards you get from things like chests, skulltulas, and more with the built-in randomizer! Endless replayability! The integrated randomizer completely changes how you experience the game by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Randomizing item locations</strong>: Chests, heart pieces, and upgrades appear in unexpected places</li>\n<li><strong>Shuffling rewards</strong>: What you get from completing tasks is randomized</li>\n<li><strong>Logic-based randomization</strong>: Ensures the game remains completable</li>\n<li><strong>Customizable settings</strong>: Fine-tune the randomization to your preferences</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quality of Life Features</h3>\n<p>Additional features noted in this Direct include save states, an integrated cheat menu, accessibility options, and support for running the game at 60 frames per second.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Save states</strong>: Quick save and load functionality (experimental)</li>\n<li><strong>Cheat menu</strong>: Built-in cheats for experimentation and fun</li>\n<li><strong>Accessibility options</strong>: Features to make the game more accessible</li>\n<li><strong>Controller support</strong>: Full gamepad compatibility alongside keyboard and mouse</li>\n<li><strong>Mod support</strong>: Extensive modding capabilities</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Authentic Experience Toggle</h3>\n<p>We are careful to put any and all changes to the authentic game behind toggles, so that if desired you can play it in all of its 1998 glory This means you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enable or disable any enhancement individually</li>\n<li>Play with the original look and feel</li>\n<li>Customize your experience based on preference</li>\n<li>Switch between modern and classic modes at any time</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>System Requirements</h2>\n<h3>Minimum Requirements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Operating System</strong>: Windows 10/11, macOS 10.14+, or Linux</li>\n<li><strong>Processor</strong>: Any modern CPU (Intel Core i3 or AMD equivalent)</li>\n<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 4GB RAM</li>\n<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: DirectX 11 compatible GPU</li>\n<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 2GB available space</li>\n<li><strong>Additional</strong>: Legal ROM of Ocarina of Time</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Recommended Specifications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Operating System</strong>: Windows 11 or latest macOS/Linux</li>\n<li><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5</li>\n<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 8GB RAM</li>\n<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Dedicated GPU (GTX 1060 or RX 580 equivalent)</li>\n<li><strong>Storage</strong>: SSD with 5GB available space</li>\n<li><strong>Monitor</strong>: 1440p or 4K display for best visual experience</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Setting Up Ship of Harkinian</h2>\n<h3>Step 1: Obtain a Legal ROM</h3>\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: We are not distributing any Nintendo owned IP.
