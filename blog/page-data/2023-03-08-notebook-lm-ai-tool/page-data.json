It's designed to help you read, take notes, and organize your ideas. \n</code></pre>\n<p>I think you may need a google account, but otherwise I have found all the features to be free.</p>\n<h2>How does it work?</h2>\n<p>You can upload various files and links, even local large documents. You can provide it URL links to articles and YouTube video links. It will digest this information and provide you with an AI chat bot that you can use to ask it to summarize, or other random questions about the content. I have found the AI isn't incredibly impressive compared to other LLMs I have used.</p>\n<h2>Audio Commentary</h2>\n<p>This is where this tool shines. It will create audio commentary (basically a podcast) about the content that you have provided it. The audio sounds very realistic, with by default a lady and man speaking to each other. Check this youtube video out I made in a NotebookLM project about Orchestrated Objective Reduction:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T2yHN3wnxg\">Link to YoutubeVideo</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"NotebookLM AI Research Tool","date":"2025-03-08T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2023-03-08-notebook-lm-ai-tool/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
